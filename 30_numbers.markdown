# Numbers (Integers and Floating Point) 
### what is an operator and operands?
operator: + -   *   /   //  %     
operands: in (1 + 2), 1 and 2 are operands 
### Arithmetic Operation
#### Addition
```python
a = 1
b = 2
c = a + b
print(c)

a = a + b
# a += b
print(a)
```
#### Subtraction
```python
a = 5 
b = 3 
# a = a - b  
# a -= b 
print(a)
```

#### Multiplication
```python
a = 5 
b = 3 
a *= b 
# a = a * b
print(a)
```

# Division  
```python
a = 8 
b = 4 
# a = a / b 
# a /= b
print(a)
```

# Floor Division 
The // operator (two forward slashes) truncates the decimal without rounding and returns an integer result.
```python
a = 3 
b = 2 
print(a // b)
```

# Modulo 
The // operator (two forward slashes) truncates the decimal without rounding and returns an integer result.
4 goes into 7 once, with a remainder of 3. The % operator returns the remainder after division.    
```python
a = 3 
b = 2 
print(a % b)   
a = 743 
print(a % 10)
```
# powers 
The // operator (two forward slashes) truncates the decimal without rounding and returns an integer result.
4 goes into 7 once, with a remainder of 3. The % operator returns the remainder after division.    
```python
print(2**3)
```

# powers 
`PEMDAS`  (Parentheses, Exponents,Multiplication, Division, Addition and Subtraction.)
    
```python
a = (2 + 10) * (10 + 3)
b = 2 + 10 * 10 + 3
print(a)
print(b)
```
