animal-crackers code challenge

Write a function takes two-word string and returns True if both words
begin with same letter

Example 1:
animal_crackers('Levelheaded Llama')   output: True
explanation:
first word (Levelheaded) starts with letter 'L' and second word in the string (Llama) stars with 'L'
since the two letters are equal, we return true

Example 1:
animal_crackers('Crazy Kangaroo')   output: False
explanation:
first word (Crazy) starts with letter 'C' and second word in the string (Kangaroo) stars with 'K'
since the two letters C and K aren't equal, we return false

Example 3:
animal_crackers('Cute cat')   output: True
explanation:
first word (Cute) starts with letter 'C' and second word in the string (cat) stars with 'c'
since the two letters are equal, we return true
