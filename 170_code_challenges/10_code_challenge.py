"""
Write a function that returns the lesser of two given numbers if both numbers are even,
but returns the greater if one or both numbers are odd.

Example 1:
lesser_of_two_evens(2, 4)   output: 2
explanation:
the two parameters 2 and 4 are even numbers, therefore, we'll return the smallest even number

Example 2:
lesser_of_two_evens(2, 5)   output: 5
explanation:
the first parameter 2 is even, but the second parameter 5 is odd, therefore, we'll return the greatest number

Example 3:
lesser_of_two_evens(7, 5)   output: 7
explanation:
the two parameters are odd, therefore, we'll return the greatest number
