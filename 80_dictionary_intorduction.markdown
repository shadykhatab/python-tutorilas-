- Dictionaries are unordered mappings for storing objects. 
- Dictionaries use a Key-Value pairing instead. 
- The Key-Value pair allows you to quickly grab objects without needing to know an index location 

```python
# Example: 
{'key1': 'value1', 'key2': 'value2'}
```
 
- Differences between dictionary and list: 
    - Dictionaries: objects retrieved by key name. Unordered. 
    - Lists: objects retrieved by index. Can be sliced and indexed.
